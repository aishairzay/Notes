CMDA Final Exam topics

Process:
  Sensemaking loop
  Fundamental analytical tasks ( read paper about it - stasko )

Data Processing:
  Data Structures
    lists
    tuple
    dictionary
    table (Cardinality, Dimensions)
          (n, p)

Data Transformations:
  List
    sort
    map
    filter
    reduce
    vectorize
  Table
    Join by a unique identifier 
      -> increasing columns, preserving # of rows
    Pivot
    Aggregate (group-by)
    Transpose
    Union
      -> increasing rows, preserving # of columns
    Selection
      -> selecting rows from a table, filtering for rows
    Projection
      -> selecting fewer dimensions (columns) from the table

Data Cleaning:
  Masking
  Imputation - filling in missing data

Data Programming Concepts:
  Functional Programming
  Applying functions to data
  List comprehensions
      [expr(e) for e in list]
  Vector Programming

Data Visualization:
  Mapping Data table -> graphics
    -step 1: rows become marks (map each student to a doc)
    -step 2: columns become visual attributes of the marks
      - 4 kinds of marks (PLAG)
        - Points
        - Lines
        - Area
        - Volume (just area with another dimension)
        - Glyphs
  Expressiveness & Effectiveness
    Different marks have different levels of effectiviness
      - Order of effectiveness
        1. Position
        2. Length
        3 or 4. Size
        4 or 4. Color
    Expressiveness -> may have more than 1 type of data for example: quantitative vs qualitative data
      Some visual attributes may over-express our data.
      Must choose channels that express what we need.
  Low-Dimensional Plots
    - Histograms (good for 1 dimension)
    - Scatter (good for 2 dimensions)
    - Bar, stack (few dimensions)
  Multi-Dimensional Plots
    - Tabular - HeatMap (Show with colors in a nice table)
    - Glyph
    - Axis Arrangement
      - using parallel coordinates
    - Multiple Views
      - Make a bunch of scatterplots or something in a nice/organized way
      - SPLOMS -> Scatter plot matrices
        - Brushing and Linking with these, to see the same values among different dimensions
    - Interactive Filter
      - Dynamic Queries (DQ)
        - sliders to filter out data on specific attributes

Visual Programming Concepts
  Event Based Programming - responding/callback for when the mouse or something is clicked
  Picking - when we specifically click on data elements

Data Analytics
  Low-Dimension analytics
    - 1D-means
    - 2D-correlation
  Feature Scaling
  Metrics
    - Distance Metric
      - Euclidian
      - Taxi Cab Metric (Manhattan distance)
      - Categorial Data (distance between male and female?)
    - Distance Matrix
      - Distance between all pairs of data points
      - Provides matrix of size n X n (number of rows by number of rows)
    - Dim Reduction
      - MDS - Multi-Dimensional Scaling
          - Finding a lower dimensional representation of those data points that represents the high-level distance between the data points
          - Error in the plot = Sum of (all low dimensional distances - all high dimensional distances)
            - goal is to minimize this error, then show the data.
      - PCA - maximizing variance
      - n-Clustering
        - Kmeans -> K = how many clusters to look for
          - Tries to find K centroids such that the distance of all the data to its nearest centroid summed up is minimized.

Text Analytics
  - Vector Space Model
    - p is number of words
    - n is the documents
    Creates a bag of words
    - Doc x term frequency matrix
    - TF-IDF metric for term frequency - inverse document frequency
      - how many documents contain that word?
        - all contain it -> not such a useful word in that data set
      - only some docs contain it?
        - can mean something
      - = (Term frequency) * (inverse document frequency)
  - Stop words
    - filter out boring words
  - Sentiment Analysis
    - counting positive words
    - counting negative words
  - Similarity Metrics
    - cos similarity metrics -> Dot product of the two vectors

Web Scraping - beautifulsoup
  - Navigate HTML tree
  - Search on unique tags or attributes

Questions:

Short answer - working previous notes - understanding concepts and the math for them and all
